% Example file NB in matlab % comments out text
function ShowSpeciation

% The first thing to do is to extract the frequencies 
% from each file
% what I'll do is loop through each file, extract the frequencies and store
% them in a matrix

GenNums=[1999]; % you will have all the generations numbers 
                % in this variable ie GenNums=[99,199,299, ...]
for i=1:length(GenNums)
    
    % load each file
    GenData=load(['generation_' int2str(GenNums(i) '.txt'],'-ascii');
    
    % Extract the 2nd column
    SpeciesVals=GenData(:,2);
    
    % Use 'hist' to extract frequencies
    % See the help on hist for precise details but it basically
    % m=hist(x,BinCentres) bins the data in x into bins whos centres are 
    % specified in BinCentres. 
    BinCentres=1:100;
    % In this code I have assumed you want 100 bins and values are 1 to 100
    % but if you wanted frequencies for only 10 bins (0-10, 10-20 etc
    % You would do: BinCentres = 5:10:95;
    
    % get frequencies and put them into the i'th row of a matrix
    Freqs(i,:)=hist(SpeciesVals,BinCentres);
end

% Finally
